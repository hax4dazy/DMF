# DMF
DMF (Discord Message Forwarder) is a discord bot written in JavaScript

You'll need NODEJS and some kind of JavaScript editor to configure this. 
Also because i am a lazy c*nt I really don't want to add anything of like a json file witch you can configure the token in.

NODEJS: 
https://nodejs.org/en/

VS Code:

To run the bot you'll have to add in your own bot token first. You can get that here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/

Then on windows just type `NODE index.js` in cmd or powershell to start the bot up after you have put the token in.
