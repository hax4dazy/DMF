# DMF
DMF (Discord Message Forwarder) is a discord bot written in JavaScript

You'll need NODEJS and some kind of JavaScript editor to configure this. 
Also because I am a lazy person and I really don't want to add anything of like a json file which you can configure the token in.

NODEJS: 
https://nodejs.org/en/

VS Code:

You'll also need discord.js which you can install through this command:
`npm install discord.js`

To run the bot you'll have to add in your own bot token first. You can get that here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/

Then on windows just type `node index.js` in Command Prompt or Powershell to run the bot.
